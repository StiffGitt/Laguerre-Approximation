# Laguerre-Approximation
Implementation of mean-square Laguerre approximation using 10-point Gauss-Laguerre quadrature

The project consists of:

* Matlab functions implementing the method (P2Z27_MWA_laguerre_approx.m file)
* Matlab functions implementing the 40-point quadrature variation of the method (laguerre_approx40.m file)
* Matlab scripts testing convergence of given method 
* Matlab scripts testing numerical properties of given method
* A report containing method description and analysis of numerical properties
